        <h1>Formal vs. Informal "You": Sie and du</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>In German, there are two ways to say "you". This is a very important concept to understand for speaking politely.</p>

        <h3>The Formal "Sie"</h3>
        <p>Use "Sie" when talking to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adults you don't know</li>
            <li>People in positions of authority (e.g., police, teachers)</li>
            <li>In professional or business situations</li>
            <li>To show respect to older people</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The verb form used with "Sie" is the infinitive (the basic form, e.g., "kommen", "heißen"). "Sie" is also always capitalized in writing.</p>

        <h3>The Informal "du"</h3>
        <p>Use "du" when talking to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Friends</li>
            <li>Family members</li>
            <li>Children and people much younger than you</li>
            <li>Peers in casual situations (like at a university)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The verb form changes when you use "du" (e.g., "kommst", "heißt").</p>

        <hr>
        <h3>General Rule</h3>
        <p>When in doubt, always use the formal "Sie". It is polite to wait for the other person (especially if they are older or in a higher position) to offer the informal "du" to you. This is called "das Du anbieten".</p>
